## Igpay Atinlay

Build a function that will translate text into "Pig Latin" Take the first consonant and move it to the end of a word and then affix "ay" to the end of that word."

- Write a function that takes one parameter
	- Parameter 1 - A string
- The function should output your input string translated into Pig Latin
	- Example: 
		- `var myString = "Hello my name is Stu"`
		- `translate(myString);
		- Output - `"ellohay ymay ameya siay tusay"`

#### Making it better!

- There are several more rules to Pig Latin, try incorporating as many as you can into your function.
	- There are different rules for words that start with vowel sounds or silent letters for example.
	- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">Here</a> is a link to an explanation of all the rules.
- Also try maintaining capitalization of words that are capitalized in your input string.
	- Example: 
		- `"Hello there"` would be `"Ellohay heretay"`
