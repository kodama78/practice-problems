Create a function, find_factors(), that does the following:
- Find all of the factors of a given number

#### Input: 
- factor_number: a number to find the factors of

#### Output: 
- output array, an array of all numbers that are a factor of factor_number

#### Example:
var factor_number = 10;

output = find_factors(factor_number);
console.log(output); //outputs [1,2,5,10];

#### Put your solution in answer.js

- hint: use modulo to determine if a number is evenly divisible by another number
